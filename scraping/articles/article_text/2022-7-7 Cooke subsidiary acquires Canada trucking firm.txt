BODY: " Cooke transportation subsidiary Shoreland has acquired Connors Transfer Limited, a provider of trucking and transportation services, according to the company.   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  With the acquisition, Shoreland Transport is now one of the largest trucking companies in Atlantic Canada, Cooke said.   Connors was founded in Nova Scotia in 1982 by brothers Glenn and Lauchie Connors. The business began as a small operation with two trucks delivering dry goods to grocery stores in Nova Scotia, eventually moving to fresh and frozen produce.  Over the last 40 years, the company has grown to a fleet of 143 trucks and 261 trailers with four terminal locations.  "There are many challenges for logistics in today's environment, and this acquisition will further strengthen Cooke's vertical integration," said Glenn Cooke, CEO of Cooke.   "Many of Connors customers operate in food retail and agri-food, so their business and fleet align very well with Shoreland's current operations, and will enable us to improve services with our customers."  Shoreland was established by Cooke in 2002, and has terminals in Nova Scotia and Virginia. It operates a fleet of 115 trucks and 217 trailers with routes across Canada and throughout the United States.   Shoreland primarily moves fresh salmon and seafood products for Cooke Aquaculture companies, as well as other customers in Atlantic Canada.  The companies will operate all terminals and facilities and continue to focus on driver retention and recruitment, with an aim to grow its customer base and routes, Cooke said.
