LEAD: Company plans to use what it calls 
BODY: " Arizona-based Royal Caridea, a startup using recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) technology to raise white shrimp in a stacked raceway system, is hoping to raise $1.5 million (€1.47 million) in series A funding to propel the project forward.   The company is using the Harvest Returns crowdfunding platform to raise $1.32 million (€1.3 million) of the funding round, and through July 6 had raised $540,000 (€530,195), according to Harvest Returns.   Fund raising through the crowdfunding site closes in just over a week.  The company is currently growing shrimp in ponds and in a greenhouse in Gila Bend, Arizona, about 70 miles south of Phoenix. In 2021, it produced 10,000 pounds.  The company said it plans to use the funding to build what it calls a GEN-2 stacked raceway production system.   "The first plant will be comprised of eight GEN-2 raceways stacked as to form an enclosed system, or GEN-2 production unit, outwardly resembling a shipping container," the company said. The unit is expected to produce 23,000 pounds of shrimp annually.   By combining these production units over time, the company hopes to produce 1.33 million pounds and will discontinue raising shrimp in traditional ponds.  Royal Caridea said it expects to see its sales grow from over $140,000 (€137,460) in 2021 to over $20 million (€19.6 million) in 2026.  To date, the farmer has been selling its conventionally raised shrimp in frozen product forms for between $6 (€5.89) to $11.00 (€10.80) per pound.   It plans to sell live and fresh-never-frozen products when its GEN-2 growing system is up and running.   The company in 2020 received a $2.2 million (€2.16 million) US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-backed loan.  The Harvest Returns crowdfunding platform has been used in the past by other aquaculture startups.  In January, US land-based pompano farmer Aquaco raised $600,000 (€530,000) through the platform .  In 2021 US-based land-based salmon farmer Finger Lakes Fish, which does business under the LocalCoho name, fell short of its goal of raising over $3 million (€2.5 million) in new investment through the Harvest Returns platform.  LocalCoho is developing an indoor salmon farm in upstate New York, and was seeking up to $3.15 million (€2.6 million) in fresh capital in exchange for approximately 21 percent equity in the company.
