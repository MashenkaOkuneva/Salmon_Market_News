    "\n",
    "When you're dealing with words in text, you end up with tens of thousands of word classes to analyze; one for each word in a vocabulary. Trying to one-hot encode these words is massively inefficient because most values in a one-hot vector will be set to zero. So, the matrix multiplication that happens in between a one-hot input vector and a first, hidden layer will result in mostly zero-valued hidden outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem and greatly increase the efficiency of our networks, we use what are called **embeddings**. Embeddings are just a fully connected layer like you've seen before. We call this layer the embedding layer and the weights are embedding weights. We skip the multiplication into the embedding layer by instead directly grabbing the hidden layer values from the weight matrix. We can do this because the multiplication of a one-hot encoded vector with a matrix returns the row of the matrix corresponding the index of the \"on\" input unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='lookup_matrix.png' width=50%>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing the matrix multiplication, we use the weight matrix as a lookup table. We encode the words as integers, for example \"heart\" is encoded as 958, \"mind\" as 18094. Then to get hidden layer values for \"heart\", you just take the 958th row of the embedding matrix. This process is called an **embedding lookup** and the number of hidden units is the **embedding dimension**.\n",
    " \n",
    "There is nothing magical going on here. The embedding lookup table is just a weight matrix. The embedding layer is just a hidden layer. The lookup is just a shortcut for the matrix multiplication. The lookup table is trained just like any weight matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings aren't only used for words of course. You can use them for any model where you have a massive number of classes. A particular type of model called **Word2Vec** uses the embedding layer to find vector representations of words that contain semantic meaning."

    "\n",
    "For every example we give the network, we train it using the output from the softmax layer. That means for each input, we're making very small changes to millions of weights even though we only have one true example. This makes training the network very inefficient. We can approximate the loss from the softmax layer by only updating a small subset of all the weights at once. We'll update the weights for the correct example, but only a small number of incorrect, or noise, examples. This is called [\"negative sampling\"](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two modifications we need to make. First, since we're not taking the softmax output over all the words, we're really only concerned with one output word at a time. Similar to how we use an embedding table to map the input word to the hidden layer, we can now use another embedding table to map the hidden layer to the output word. Now we have two embedding layers, one for input words and one for output words. Secondly, we use a modified loss function where we only care about the true example and a small subset of noise examples.\n",

    "This is a little complicated so we'll go through it bit by bit. $u_{w_O}\\hspace{0.001em}^\\top$ is the embedding vector for our \"output\" target word (transposed, that's the $^\\top$ symbol) and $v_{w_I}$ is the embedding vector for the \"input\" word. Then the first term \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\large \\sum_i^N \\mathbb{E}_{w_i \\sim P_n(w)}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This means we're going to take a sum over words $w_i$ drawn from a noise distribution $w_i \\sim P_n(w)$. The noise distribution is basically our vocabulary of words that aren't in the context of our input word. In effect, we can randomly sample words from our vocabulary to get these words. $P_n(w)$ is an arbitrary probability distribution though, which means we get to decide how to weight the words that we're sampling. This could be a uniform distribution, where we sample all words with equal probability. Or it could be according to the frequency that each word shows up in our text corpus, the unigram distribution $U(w)$. The authors found the best distribution to be $U(w)^{3/4}$, empirically. \n",

    "<img src=\"assets/neg_sampling_loss.png\" width=50%>\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you an intuition for what we're doing here, remember that the sigmoid function returns a probability between 0 and 1. The first term in the loss pushes the probability that our network will predict the correct word $w_O$ towards 1. In the second term, since we are negating the sigmoid input, we're pushing the probabilities of the noise words towards 0."
